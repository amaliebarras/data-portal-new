notes: "Since 1981 Travis Central Appraisal District has had one primary mission,\r\nto provide accurate appraisal of all property in Travis County at one\r\nhundred percent market value, equally and uniformly, in a professional,\r\nethical, economical and courteous manner, working to ensure that each\r\ntaxpayer pays only their fair share of the property tax burden.\r\n\r\nTCAD provides exports of appraisal data for a charge of $55 per export.\r\n\r\nA donor has provided us with two datasets, the final tax rolls of 2005,\r\nand a preliminary snapshot of 2015. The data, as provided by TCAD, is\r\nin this directory.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these datasets are intended for use with Microsoft\r\nAccess.  We are looking for a volunteer to help convert to a more\r\nconsumable format."
