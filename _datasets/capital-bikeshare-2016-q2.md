notes: "When a rental occurs within the system our software collects basic data about the trip. That data can be exported from our system and used for various types of analysis or research. By making this data available we hope to stimulate that analysis or research amongst a much wider community. Please note, all private data including member names has been removed from these files.\r\nTogether, Arlington and the District of Columbia established the regional Capital Bikeshare system that now offers over 370 stations and 3100+ bikes."
