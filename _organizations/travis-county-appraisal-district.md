title: Travis County Appraisal District
description: >-
  Since 1981 Travis Central Appraisal District has had one primary mission, to
  provide accurate appraisal of all property in Travis County at one hundred
  percent market value, equally and uniformly, in a professional, ethical,
  economical and courteous manner, working to ensure that each taxpayer pays
  only their fair share of the property tax burden.  TCAD provides exports of
  appraisal data for a charge of $55 per export.  A donor has provided us with
  two datasets, the final tax rolls of 2005, and a preliminary snapshot of 2015.
  The data, as provided by TCAD, is in this directory.  Please note that these
  datasets are intended for use with Microsoft Access.  We are looking for a
  volunteer to help convert to a more consumable format.
