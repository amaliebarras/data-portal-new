  Open Austin is a volunteer citizen brigade advocating for open government,
  open data, and civic application development since 2009. We are an official
  brigade affiliated with the nonprofit Code for America which believes
  government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. Open
  Austin is focused on the needs of our own community and we use design,
  technology, and open data to improve the quality of life in our city.
